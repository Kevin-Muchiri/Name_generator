Description
Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. The Ghanian people name their children by deriving the first name ('day name') from the day of the week they were born. 
This generator prompts a user for their birthday (year, month and date) and calculates the day of the week they were born. Depending on the User's gender the generator then outputs their Akan Name.
